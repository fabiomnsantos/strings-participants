# strings-participants
Here we use `tabula` to scrape the Strings 2021 [list of participants](https://www.ictp-saifr.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/stringsreg616.pdf)
, clean the data and do some plots.

To run it locally, make sure to do the following:

- Create a python virtual environment
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- Open strings-table.ipynb in JupyterLab
